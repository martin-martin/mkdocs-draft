We'd like to target this keyphrase: `mkdocs`

Here are articles that are closest to what we want to achieve, but I bet we can improve on them:

- <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs.html>
- <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/>

Here's the documentation on writing a Step-By-Step Project:
https://github.com/realpython/tutorial-drafts/tree/master/templates

# Document Your Python Project with MkDocs

* GitHub PR: <https://github.com/realpython/tutorial-drafts/pull/724>
* CMS Link (Edit Page, Not Preview Page): < link to be inserted by author >
* Materials PR: < link to be inserted by author, if applicable >

## Describe the project in 3 sentences or less

The reader will:

* Start with a pile of code with docstrings from a toy library (See attached `calculations.py`)
* Finish with user-friendly documentation hosted on GitHub Pages

## Who is this project for?

This project is for developers who want to find a way to produce documentation that:

* Holds the users hands and walks them through using your code
* Has the convenience of being partly autogenerated
* Looks better and feels more complete than purely autogenerated documentation

The content is suitable for beginners who can:

* `pip install`
* Set up a virtual environment
* Read Python code

## Why will your ideal reader be interested in this project?

Autogenerated documentation can be easier to maintain because some of the information is linked between your code and the docs. MkDocs allows you start with the documentation that is written into your code as docstrings, but then build it into a useful resource. This documentationcan make your project more appealing to users because it can hold the user's hand through example usage, and connect the dots between the docstings. In addition, MkDocs takes the hassle out of making your documentation look good.

The project also uses the same code base and rough structure as the sister SbSP [Document Your Python Project with Sphinx](https://trello.com/c/DFqS3n7m/773-document-your-python-project-with-sphinx), which gives readers the opportunity to contrast and compare, as well as pick up one or the other tool more quickly.

## What skills will your reader learn from building this project?

The reader will learn how to:

* Work with MkDocs to produce static pages from Markdown
* Pull in documentation from code using `mkdocstrings`
* Write Markdown text to package the documentation from the code in a helpful way
* Follow best practices for project documentation
* Use a popular theme for your documentation with `mkdocs-material`
* Host their documentation on GitHub Pages

## What technologies and libraries will the project use?

MkDocs, Markdown, `mkdocs-material`, `mkdocstrings`, GitHub

## What concepts should the reader be familiar with before starting this project?

* Create and update a repo on GitHub to integrate with Read The Docs: <https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/>
* Understand what docstrings are, what structure they follow, and what kind of information they contain: <https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/>
* Set up a virtual environment and work within it: <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>
* Install a package with pip: <https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/>
* Understand the differences and similarities between using Sphinx and Mkdocs for generating project documentation: <https://realpython.com/pbjt/blog/post/874/change/>
