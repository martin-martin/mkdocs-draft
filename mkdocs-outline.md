_Add your introduction here..._

**In this tutorial, you'll learn:**

- _Learning outcome #1_
- _Learning outcome #2_
- _Learning outcome #3_

## Demo

_Use this section to demonstrate how the project works. Include screenshots and/or a video. The idea is to give the reader an idea what exactly the end result will be, and also to get them excited about building the project._

_Demos should be recorded as a video. Here are some guidelines for optimal viewing experience:_

1. _Record videos in 16:9 format in any of the following resolutions:_
   - 720 HiDPI (preferred)
   - 1080p
   - 720p

2. _Use a large font size in your terminal to help with legibility. 36px is a good starting point. Don't go too large, either, though._

_Write a short text introduction to the video. Then, on a new line, add a TODO note to add the video. Include the video file on your PR for the article. An editor will take care of embedding the video file into your article to replace the TODO note. For more information, check out the [Animated GIFs section of the style guide]( https://realpython.com/team/style-guide/#animated-gifs)._

## Project Overview

_Use this section to give a high-level overview of how the project is built. Discuss the design of the project. Include diagrams if it makes sense. Tell the reader how the the project will be broken down into steps._

## Prerequisites

If you don't have all of the pre-requisite knowledge before starting this tutorial, that's okay! In fact, you might learn more by going ahead and getting started! You can always stop and review the resources linked here if you get stuck.

## Step 1: _Title of Step 1_

At the end of this step you will have completed _X_, _Y_, and _Z_.

_Discuss how to do X, Y, and Z._ Provide complete code examples, either inline in a few code blocks (if they are not too long), or use [collapsible sections](https://realpython.com/team/style-guide/#collapsible-sections) labeled by their file name to include long code blocks._

_At the end of this section, provide a recap of what the reader completed._

## Step 2: _Title of Step 2_

At this point, you should have _A_, _B_, and _C_ done. At the end of this step you will have completed _X_, _Y_, and _Z_.

_Discuss how to do X, Y, and Z._ Provide complete code examples, either inline in a few code blocks (if they are not too long), or use [collapsible sections](https://realpython.com/team/style-guide/#collapsible-sections) labeled by their file name to include long code blocks._

_At the end of this section, provide a recap of what the reader completed._

## Step 3: _Title of Step 3_

At this point, you should have _A_, _B_, and _C_ done. At the end of this step you will have completed _X_, _Y_, and _Z_.

_Discuss how to do X, Y, and Z._ Provide complete code examples, either inline in a few code blocks (if they are not too long), or use [collapsible sections](https://realpython.com/team/style-guide/#collapsible-sections) labeled by their file name to include long code blocks._

_At the end of this section, provide a recap of what the reader completed._

## Conclusion

_Write a conclusion that summarizes what the reader has done and what they have learned._

## Next Steps

_Encourage the reader to continue learning by either expanding the project, or taking a course or doing another project._

_For example, here's how you might encourage the reader to extend their project:_

Here are some ideas to take your project to the next level:

- _**Idea #1:** Description of Idea #1._
- _**Idea #2:** Description of Idea #2._
